With this project we aim to develop a new form of interaction and visualization for some of the planets in our solar system. Through the implementation of a system with multisensory interaction, we intend to create an immersive experience, both visual and auditory.

We used Arduino to obtain the readings of the used sensors: Aluminium (as capacitive sensor), Proximity sensor (HC-SR04), and ... .Furthermore, we also used LEDs for visual feedback and a button to serve as another input besides the mentioned sensors. These values are then passed onto TouchDesigner (the software we used to develop the application part of this project) in the order:
Reset, screen, planet, x, y, view, proximity, led button.

To run this system, you need to have Arduino and TouchDesigner installed, in order to use the files that are in this project. You also need to have the circuit assembled with the mentioned sensors and all the other components correctly connected.
